- Mario takes x2 damage in battles
- Enemies have x3 health
- Partner cards do more damage
- Roshambo no longer gives coins as a reward, and doesn't cost any coins to sneak in
- Roshambo's snack bar doesn't cost any coins
- Thing cards have a heavily increased paint cost
- Kamek can't turn your cards into replicas
- Mario gets a major movement speed buff
- Leveling up gives you more paint than before
- The amount of damage that cards do is listed on the card description, and enemy max HP is listed

## Installation
Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/L5050/Color-Splash-Reshuffled/releases) and download the most recent release (Reshuffled.zip). Unzip this into the graphics packs folder in Cemu, then right click color splash in Cemu and click "Edit Graphics Packs". You should see the Reshuffled mod under the mods section, click the checkbox and you're good to go!
* Note: it is important to use the release rather than the source code because the release contains compressed battle data which replaces one of the games files
